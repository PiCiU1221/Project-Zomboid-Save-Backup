# Project-Zomboid-Save-Backup
Simple Python script that automatically backs up your game saves in case something bad happens (as we know it always does)

# How to use on your computer?
In order to use this code you can simply load it into your Visual Studio Code with python installed and launch.\n
If you want to make it into an .exe file (like i prefer) you need to use 'PyInstaller'.\n
If you don't have it you can install it using this line in the terminal: ```pip install pyinstaller```, and then simply enter: ```pyinstaller --onefile main.py``` while inside the folder containing the main.py file.
